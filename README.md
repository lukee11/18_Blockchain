![alt=""](Images/application-image.png)



### Background
This project aims to create a blockchain-based ledger system with a user-friendly online interface. This ledger enables partner banks to undertake financial transactions (that is, money transfers between senders and receivers) and validate the ledger's data integrity.

Steps completed:

1. Create a new data class named `Record`. This class will serve as the blueprint for the financial transaction records that the blocks of the ledger will store.

2. Modify the existing `Block` data class to store `Record` data.

3. Add Relevant User Inputs to the Streamlit interface.

4. Test the PyChain Ledger by Storing Records.
